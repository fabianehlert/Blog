While seeking for an easy way to compose blog posts and also showing my portfolio I bumped into ["Hugo"](https://github.com/spf13/hugo).
I created my previous website with Adobe's Muse app. It's easy to learn and gives me a lot of different options to create my website. But I still feel it's too hard to deal with. I'm just not able to instantly publish my ideas as I always have to deal with formatting the text, moving around text boxes and other elements. It just seems to static. Okay, maybe I just haven't figured out yet how to properly set it up for a more dynamic usage but anyways it's not what I'm looking for. It's not intuitive enough for me and I also don't want to spend the time learning Muse before I can publish content.

##### What am I looking for?
I'm looking for a tool that is capable of interpreting markdown (Hugo is ;) üëç) and that doesn't require me to set up a lot and is easy to maintain. For me it is all about the content. I don't want to spend a lot of time dealing with stuff that prevents me from directly putting out my ideas.
