2014 was a weird year for me. It began with the for me eagerly awaited third season of Sherlock and me losing not only a lot of weight but also interest in iOS App development.




- what's next?
- for sure I won't be developing iOS apps forever
  - quills and parchment 4 AC (after christ)
  - 19th century: typewriter (first manual, later electric)
  - first screen-based text editors on computer
  - phone
  >> All examples of the evolution of one field
- I will probably not always stay in this field
