I’ve been writing about feeling bad a couple of times. Mainly because it helps me to better cope with it.

Feeling bad can be the result of so many different things. For me it’s mostly social situations or basically anything involving other people that can make me feel bad or very uncomfortable.

Sometimes it’s really bad. You can’t eat, you can’t sleep, you can’t talk. I’ve reached such a point again. It sucks and really hurts.

The last time it kicked in this hard, I started this exact blog of which I haven’t been taking much care over the past months. Mostly because I’ve been concentrating my entire life on my new project which I love. It’s called Steps.

I’m in a new city, new country, new environment and that’s quite overwhelming. I also haven’t been going to therapy in ten weeks.

Right now is the right time for me to get back to writing about personal things.
