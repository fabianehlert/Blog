In October of 2016 I met an amazing human being who had the simple but not so often seen idea to help people.

Before flying down to Italy to attend my favorite iOS developer conference - #pragma conference - I was going through the list of speakers who would hold a talk there to see how everybody of them lives their life.

And there I first heard about Rikke Koblauch and started reading her blogposts where I came across her idea "Steps". _»Steps helps people overcome social anxieties with fun and progressive challenges.«_ was what I read first. I continued reading about Steps, fell in love with the idea and was eagerly hoping to find the app as I believed I found a solution that would help me deal with my anxieties. If you are a regular reader of this blog you might know that social anxieties play a big role in my life, determine every single of my actions and hold me back from being myself. So I felt a bit disappointed having to find out that Steps doesn't exist as an app I can use _yet_.

I know that I am not the only one suffering from social anxieties. No, it's actually one in four who is being held back by social anxieties in their life and many people aren't even aware of that they have anxieties themselves. I feel that Steps is something that has the potential to actually make an impact in and improve someones life so I had to talk to Rikke in Italy. I waited until the conference was over so scared had I been. Everybody was getting ready to leave the conference hotel and after having walked in circles for minutes thinking about what I should say I stopped her as she was about to leave through the hotel entrance and I just said hi. It was a big challenge for me :)

After some weeks of emailing I again asked Rikke about Steps as I was so keen to get into this project. I thought asking if we could to this together was too straight forward but Rikke got back to me and asked if we could develop Steps together :) This made me very happy :-)

Steps is all about overcoming everyday fears such as talking to somebody you find very interesting by actually doing it. This therapy is called [exposure therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_therapy) and proven as the most effective one when it comes to overcoming anxieties.

With Steps you can practice exposure therapy by doing small challenges everyday that ask you to do something that scares you.

And so we started working on Steps in November 2016, shipping the first beta on December 28th 2016.
<br>In January 2017 I moved to Copenhagen to work closely with Rikke and to go full time as this is the only way to do it _right_.

It of course feels super scary not only because I've only lived with my parents so far and now I've moved to a completely new country and have a tiny room in a shared flat with two lovely girls but also because everything is so uncertain at this point and we don't know where we'll be in a few months and I have zero experience building a company but it just feels like the right thing to do now and I guess that's how you learn the most :-)

I am very excited about the future :)
