Steps is an app that helps you overcome everyday fears by doing small and fun challenges.
You do this by simply facing your fears and doing what you're afraid of.

This therapy is called [exposure therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_therapy) and proven as the most effective one when it comes to overcoming anxieties.

With Steps you can practice exposure therapy by doing small challenges everyday that ask you to do something that scares you.

In Steps you find a number of different categories featuring various everyday situations. Open one to find a challenge you feel like doing today or in the future and save it to your list. You will automatically be reminded by Steps about your saved challenges.

My Steps. That's where you find your saved challenges.

When you complete a challenge you can share your experience to wherever you like :-)

Steps is a project by [Rikke](https://twitter.com/rikkekoblauch) and me.
<br>We started working on the app in November 2016, shipping the first beta on December 28th 2016. The public release of the iOS app on the App Store is planned for February 2017.

That's us :)
