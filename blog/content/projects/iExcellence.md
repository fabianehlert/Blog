An iOS and Android App I developed for the chinese electronics company Daqo based in [Nanjing, Jiangsu](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Nanjing,+Jiangsu,+China/@32.0995425,118.457561,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x35b58c9b668dcd83:0x8ffbb60b79df1b06!8m2!3d32.060255!4d118.796877) while working at UVB-Data.

We were a team of three, working on a Windows Phone App, iOS and Android App (that was me) and the backend solution. The project itself evolved quickly after a Skype call between me and the head of UVB-Data who was visiting the Daqo headquarters in China at this time.
<br>It was my first client-based work which meant I also got to know a new concept of working together in a team with [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_\(software_development\)). In addition to that I learned working with [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_\(software\)), [localizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) content, structuring and [normalizing databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) for scale and working with different map providers at one time due to [governmental restrictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China) on the internet in China.
