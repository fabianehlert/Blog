&lt;p&gt;While seeking for an easy way to compose blog posts and also showing my portfolio I bumped into &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/spf13/hugo&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hugo&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.
I created my previous website with Adobe&amp;rsquo;s Muse app. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to learn and gives me a lot of different options to create my website. But I still feel it&amp;rsquo;s too hard to deal with. I&amp;rsquo;m just not able to instantly publish my ideas as I always have to deal with formatting the text, moving around text boxes and other elements. It just seems to static. Okay, maybe I just haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out yet how to properly set it up for a more dynamic usage but anyways it&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for. It&amp;rsquo;s not intuitive enough for me and I also don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend the time learning Muse before I can publish content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;what-am-i-looking-for:c3482be23f6832233584a447a06df954&#34;&gt;What am I looking for?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a tool that is capable of interpreting markdown (Hugo is ;) üëç) and that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require me to set up a lot and is easy to maintain. For me it is all about the content. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time dealing with stuff that prevents me from directly putting out my ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
